# Ames Housing Price Prediction

A Cython implementation of cross-validated ridge regression on the Ames Housing dataset. Based on a Python implementation in a [previous project](https://github.com/CerJesus/CS221FinalProject).

## TODO

 * Experiment with sparse data structures
 * Implement cross-validation on a given set of hyperparameters
 * Implement gradient boosting
